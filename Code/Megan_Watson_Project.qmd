## General Information

| **Investigator** | Megan Watson | **Date** | September 30, 2024 |
| **Project Title** | Quality Improvement into Standard Practice: Persistent Practice Changes and Decreased Length of Stay for 3 years following a Medical ICU Physical Therapy Quality Improvement Project |  |  |

## Project Description

### Background

             The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a MICU physical therapy (PT) quality improvement (QI) project on physical therapist practice, and quantify the changes in length of stay (LOS) and mechanical ventilation (MV) time. The goals of the QI Initiative were to increase percentage of MICU admissions receiving PT, decrease time from MICU admission to first PT, and increase the frequency of PT visits. The main question the researcher came to us with was: how to correctly model the longitudinal data in the study?

### Study Design

              This was a retrospective cohort study, comparing 3 main time periods: Pre-QI Initiative (before April 2015), During QI Initiative (April 2015-Dec 2015), and After-QI Initiative (Jan 2016 and later). The QI initiative was deployed during the 9-month period between April 2015 and December 2015, during which time there were education and staffing changes. Patients were stratified as either having mechanical ventilation or not having mechanical ventilation. The primary outcomes of interest were MICU LOS and time on MV. Secondary outcomes of interest were the non-ICU LOS, total hospital LOS, and discharge location.

### Description of the Data

              Data was received as a de-identified .csv. Data points consist of: Admit and Discharge Time, PT Consult Time, Admit to Consult Time, First Therapy Time, Consult to Therapy Time, Admit to Therapy Time, Total Therapy Visits, Days with Therapy Visits, Average, min, and Max Therapy Length, Admit and Discharge Date/Time, Total MV Days, Hospital LOS, Patient Age, Sex, “Problem List”, and Codes (presumably ICD9/10).

### Anticipated Sample Size / Study Population

              The sample size is N = \~3000-4000, consisting of patients admitted to the MICU with a LOS between 2 and 30 days (I.e. exclude \< 2 days or \> 30 days). This was a single site study performed here at Colorado University.

### Hypothesis

              The hypothesis for the study was that LOS and time on MV would decrease when comparing the pre- and intra-initiative time periods, and when comparing the pre- and post-initiative time periods. Clinical significance for this outcome is considered as a 1-2 day change in LOS. The intended end product of this project is a publication in a PT journal.

### Analysis Plan (Sketch)

              Data should first be examined for missingness, as this has not been performed. Similarly, repeat MICU admissions should be explored and controlled for to ensure independence of observations. Death during MICU stay should also be examined and adjusted for if needed. The analysis plan discussed was to utilize splines to capture the trajectory of LOS or time on MV over time by fitting smooth curves to the data. Linear contrasts should be performed to assess if there is a significant difference in LOS or time on MV when comparing two timepoints (i.e. pre- and intra-, pre- and post- , and post- and intra-QI Initiative. Supplementary analyses should be performed to assess secondary outcomes of interest of non-ICU LOS and total hospital LOS.

## Project Deliverables

             At this stage, Megan has only asked for insight into what method to use to account for variance in time for her analysis. There are currently no other deliverables.

**Timeline / Deadlines**

At this time, Megan has not asked for data analysis efforts from us.

Should this change, the anticipated project start date will be 1 week after our next meeting with her, where revisions to the Comprehensive Analysis Report are also expected to be completed.  The assigned analysts will reach out to the investigator to confirm the project timeframe and the project start date may be altered if necessary. 2 weeks will be allowed for initial data analysis by the assigned analyst.

A follow-up meeting is to occur no later than **1 month after the next meeting with Megan.** During the follow-up meeting, the project team will discuss and preliminary results of the analysis, mockup the desired tables and figures (1-2 descriptive tables, 1-2 analysis results tables and up to 4 graphs), and discuss next steps. During the follow-up meeting, the team will establish a meeting schedule for the remainder of the project. 

**Estimated Cost**

This represents our best estimate of the effort needed to complete the project. Should the scope of work change substantially, the analyst(s) will discuss changes with the investigator and issue a new or amended project agreement.

# Data Preparation

Let's begin by loading our libraries

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(naniar) # Used to visualize missing data
library(kableExtra) # Used for pretty printing (kable_styling)
library(table1) # Used to make Table 1
library(gridExtra) # Used to plot ggplots side by side
library(bestNormalize) # Used to find best transformation for a variable
library(corrplot) # Used for correlation matrix
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(lmtest) # Used for likelihood ratio test
```

Import the data set.

```{r}
data <- read_csv("C:/Users/sviea/Documents/Statistical Consulting/Vieau_Project_01/Data Raw/MICUPT_Deidentify.csv")
names(data)[1] <- "id" # Rename the wonky id column
```

And take a look at our data.

```{r}
glimpse(data)
```

It looks like everything is formatted correctly for the most part.

Percents are coded as doubles.

`Admit_MonthYear` is a string (e.g. "2011-08") that we may have to process in order to create variables for the 3 main time periods: Pre-QI Initiative (before April 2015), During QI Initiative (April 2015-Dec 2015), and After-QI Initiative (Jan 2016 and later).

Let's take a look at our data for good measure.

```{r}
# Pretty print header of wideform data
kable(head(data), format = "html", full_width = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

Looks good.

## Missingness

```{r}
gg_miss_var(data)
```

We are missing the most data in `MV_Total` , followed by `CONSULT TO TREAT`, `ADMIT TO TREAT`, and `PROBLEM LIST DX CODES`. Missingness does not seem to be an issue for the rest of the variables.

```{r}
vis_miss(data)
```

Immediately concerning is the 65% missing data on `MV_TOTAL`, the variable for total time on mechanical ventilation, which happens to me a main outcome of interest.

`CONSULT TO TREAT` has 56% missing and `ADMIT TO TREAT` has 55% missing. This could be because, in emergency situations where immediate critical care is required, patients might be directly admitted to the MICU without a formal consult.

`PROBLEM LIST DX CODES` and `PROBLEM LIST DX NAME` have 25% and 20% missing, respectively. Odd that their missingness doesn't align exactly. This isn't actually too bad, and our sample size is large enough that we may still be able to include these variables in our analysis if we wanted to. We'd just have to do some processing to place patients into large enough overarching diagnosis categories that we'd have enough patients in each group. Not the researcher's primary research question however so not looking any further into it. We'd also have to examine missingness and see if there are and patterns or it's MCAR.

#### Summary

Based on the initial missingness checks, we will exclude variables with excessive missingness.

These variables will be retained for reporting in Table 1 for the researcher, but will be excluded from consideration in the analysis.

-   `Consult to Treat` and `Admit to Treat` are missing \>= 55% of values, and will thus be excluded from analysis.

-   `Problem List DX Codes` is missing 25% and `Problem List DX Names` is missing 20% of values. Additionally, it would be challenging to include these variables in the analysis in a meaningful way due to sample size limitations, so these will be excluded from consideration in the final analysis.

-   `Admit to Consult` is missing 23% of values.

All other variables were missing \< 1% and thus missingness does not need to be addressed for these variables.

## Data Quality Check

Let's perform some simple min/max checks to assess if data has been entered correctly.

```{r}
# This function summarizes the mins and maxes of numeric variables
summarize_column <- function(column) {
  if (is.numeric(column)) {
    return(data.frame(
      Type = "Numeric",
      Min = min(column, na.rm = TRUE),
      Max = max(column, na.rm = TRUE)
    ))
  }
}

# Apply the function to each column and bind the results into a single data frame
summary_df <- map_dfr(data, summarize_column, .id = "Column") %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ format(., scientific = FALSE))) # Eliminates scientific notation

# Pretty print the mins and maxes of longform data_2
kable(summary_df, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

`HOSPITAL LOS` has a range of 4 to 9270. Presumably this is in hours, so a range of 0.01 to 386.25 days in the hospital. I believe the variable we are actually interested in for MICU LOS is `UNIT LOS` however, so a range of 1 to1811 hours, or 0.41 to 75.46 days. (Just realized none of us asked for a data dictionary even though it was a room of \~20 stats master's students 😅).

The researcher outlined the exclusion criteria of \< 2 days or \> 30 days in the MICU for her investigation. It looks like we will have to [filter the data set](#Filtering) to match these criteria.

`CONSULT TO TREAT` has a range of -405 to 3056. `ADMIT TO TREAT` has a range of -1 to 983. I think these variables are the time from consultation or admission until the time treatment for that patient began. Again, without a data dictionary I am unsure what to make of those negative values.

Importantly, `AVG, MAX, and MIN THERAPY LENGTH` all have negative values for the minimums. This doesn't make any sense at face value, will have to investigate and circle back to the researchers for how this data was coded.

Some variables like `MV_Total` are in hours, and some like `DAYS WITH THERAPY VISITS` are in days. I don't think we need to run any conversions, but this will be important to at least keep track of for interpretations.

Aside from that everything else looks coded properly.

## Filtering {#Filtering}

Let's go ahead and filter the data set according to the experimenter's exclusion criteria of \< 2 days or \> 30 days in the MICU so we are not unnecessarily investigating superfluous data in our continued examinations.

```{r}
# Filter data set based on researcher's exclusion criteria
data_ex <- data[data$Unit_LOS >= 48 & data$Unit_LOS <= 720,]

# Check dimensions
dim(data_ex)
```

We now have a dataset of 6430 patients!

## Data Cleaning {#Clean}

Here we will go one by one through our potential covariates and make sure they are all properly coded and there are no erroenous values.

:::: panel-tabset
```{r}
# Get counts
table(data_ex$SEX)

# Create barplot
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = SEX, fill = SEX)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Counts by Sex",
       x = "Sex",
       y = "Counts") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2")
```

`SEX` looks good and does not require any more cleaning.

## ICD10 Code

Note: `PROBLEM LIST DX CODES` and `PROBLEM LIST DX CODES` have 100's of levels comprising sundry diagnoses.

Without a direction for the specific use of these variables we can't do much with them, so they will likely be excluded from the final analysis.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Department Before MICU

```{r}
# Get counts
pretty_print(table(data_ex$`DEPT BEFORE Unit`))
```

I lack the clinical knowledge to make use of this variable.

It will likely not be used in the final analysis.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Department after MICU

```{r}
# Get counts
pretty_print(table(data_ex$`DEPT AFTER Unit`))
```

Similarly, I lack the clinical knowledge to make use of this variable without a specific direction from the researcher. It will likely be excluded in this analysis.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Admit to Consult

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`ADMIT TO CONSULT`", 25)
```

Try a log transform.

```{r}
# Perform log transform
data_ex$ADMIT_TO_CONSULT_log <- log(data_ex$`ADMIT TO CONSULT`)

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "ADMIT_TO_CONSULT_log", 25)
```

This looks incredibly messy to use. And has 23% missing values. We will likely exclude.

Could we convert it to a binary variable of whether the patient received a consult or not?

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Consult to Treat

`CONSULT TO TREAT` contained negative values. Let's explore

```{r}
# Create histogram for time from consult to treatment
hist(data_ex$`CONSULT TO TREAT`)
```

Looks like we have a lot of values extending below 0, so it's not just some mis-entered data.

```{r}
# Sort by time from consult to treatment
sorted_data <- data_ex |> 
  arrange(`CONSULT TO TREAT`) |> 
  select(id, `CONSULT TO TREAT`)

# Pretty print table
pretty_print(head(sorted_data))
```

`CONSULT TO TREAT` looks coded correctly. I believe it just has an event at timepoint zero, most likely admit.

#### Summary

`CONSULT TO TREAT` is coded correctly. However it has 56% missing values and will thus not be used.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Admit to Treat

The -1 value we saw as the min for `ADMIT TO TREAT` makes me suspicious that's how missing data was coded for this variable.

```{r}
# Create histogram for time from admit to treatment
hist(data_ex$`ADMIT TO TREAT`)
```

The histogram shows there were very few patients with a value of -1.

```{r}
# Sort by time from admit to treatment
sorted_data <- data_ex %>%
  arrange(`ADMIT TO TREAT`) %>%
  select(id, `ADMIT TO TREAT`)

# Pretty print table
kable(head(sorted_data), format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "hover", "striped"))
```

There were only 2 patients with an admit to treatment time of -1, and 1 patient with a value of 0. Will have to double check with the experimenters but this looks believable.

#### Summary

There are two patients with a -1 time to admit.

However, `ADMIT TO TREAT` has 55% missing values and will thus not be included in the final analysis.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Total Therapy Visits

`TOTAL THERAPY VISITS` is a promising covariate.

Those who had more therapy days could have a quicker recovery if physical therapy improves patient condition.

Or alternatively, more therapy days could be indicative of worse physical health, and could potentially increase the outcome variables of total MV time and MICU LOS.

Either way it is prudent to account for it in the model.

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`TOTAL THERAPY VISITS`", 25)
```

Let's try a log transform.

```{r}
# Perform log transform of average therapy length
data_ex$TOTAL_THERAPY_VISITS_log <- log(data_ex$`TOTAL THERAPY VISITS`)

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "TOTAL_THERAPY_VISITS_log", 8)
```

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

#### Summary

`TOTAL THERAPY VISITS` appears to have a logarithmic distribution. Poisson regression should take care of this

## Days with Therapy Visits

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`DAYS WITH THERAPY VISITS`", 8)
```

`DAYS WITH THERAPY VISITS` appears to be coded correctly. Poisson regression will handle the distribution.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## 

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`PERCENT OF DAYS WITH THERAPY VISITS`", 8)
```

Interesting, there was a lot of patients with either 0 or 100% of their days including physical therapy.

This could be a good covariate to include in the final model.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Therapy Length

::: panel-tabset
## Negative Therapy Length

We saw earlier that average, min, and max therapy length had negative values for their minimum, which does not make sense. Let's investigate.

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`AVG THERAPY LENGTH`", 8)
```

Ah, we can see that we have a one incredibly low and negative values, and some incredibly high values.

```{r}
# Create a table to checkout our frequencies for low and high values
table(data_ex$`AVG THERAPY LENGTH`)
```

We have 1 patient with a -1424 average length in therapy that is most likely an erroneous entry, and some patients with very high times in therapy.

I wonder who that patient is that is so advanced they've spent negative time in therapy.

```{r}
# Investigate patient with negative therapy lengths
negative <- data_ex[data_ex$`AVG THERAPY LENGTH` == -1424,] %>% 
  select(id, `AVG THERAPY LENGTH`, `MIN THERAPY LENGTH`, `MAX THERAPY LENGTH`)

# Pretty Print
kable(negative, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "hover", "striped"))
```

Aha! This patient has negative values for all therapy lengths.

Let's see if they are the only one that has negative values.

```{r}
table(data_ex$`MIN THERAPY LENGTH`)
table(data_ex$`MAX THERAPY LENGTH`)
```

They are! What probably happened here was their minimum is actually 85, and their max is actually 2726, and those got reversed into negatives somehow. Similarly, their average should be 1424.

We'll double check with the investigator, but for now let's just delete this patient and re run the histogram and qqplot.

```{r}
# Remove negative patient
data_ex <- data_ex %>% filter(data_ex$id != 10462)
```

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Average Therapy Length

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`AVG THERAPY LENGTH`", 20)
```

We may have some outliers that spent very long in therapy

```{r}
# Examine potential outliers
data_ex |> 
  arrange(desc(`AVG THERAPY LENGTH`)) |> 
  select(id, `MIN THERAPY LENGTH`, `MAX THERAPY LENGTH`, `AVG THERAPY LENGTH`) |>
  head(n=10) |> 
  pretty_print()
```

Success! That is not a logarithmic relationship, that's just 8 patients who had an extremely long stay in therapy.

Let's set these values to `NA`.

```{r}
# Filter out outlier patients
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(`AVG THERAPY LENGTH` = ifelse(id %in% c(178, 12985, 3230, 2942, 12803, 12640, 6661, 10917), NA, `AVG THERAPY LENGTH`))
```

and re-plot

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`AVG THERAPY LENGTH`", 20)
```

That's a normal distribution with a preponderance of patients who did not have physical therapy.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Max Therapy Length

```{r}
# Set outlier values to NA
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(`MAX THERAPY LENGTH` = ifelse(id %in% c(178, 12985, 3230, 2942, 12803, 12640, 6661, 10917), NA, `MAX THERAPY LENGTH`))

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`MAX THERAPY LENGTH`", 20)
```

Max therapy appears mostly normally distributed, not including the patients that did not receive PT.

The highest patient has a max length of 140, and the next highest has a max stay of \~100. Not drastic enough to call that patient an outlier.

#### Summary

`MAX THERAPY LENGTH` appears normally distributed for those that received PT.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Min Therapy Length

```{r}
# Set outlier values to NA
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(`MIN THERAPY LENGTH` = ifelse(id %in% c(178, 12985), NA, `MIN THERAPY LENGTH`))

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`MIN THERAPY LENGTH`", 20)
```

#### Summary

`MIN THERAPY LENGTH` appears mostly normal for thos who received it.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)
:::

## Days Post MICU

This variable represents the number of days a patient has spent in a standard hospital unit after being discharged from the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`ACTUAL DAYS POST MICU`", 20)
```

It appears logarithmic.

```{r}
# Log transform variable
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(ACTUAL_DAYS_POST_MICU_log = log(`ACTUAL DAYS POST MICU`))

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "ACTUAL_DAYS_POST_MICU_log", 15)
```

That appears normally distributed now!

#### Summary

Days post MICU is normal after log transforming.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Post MICU PT or OT Visits

This variable represents the number of days that patients have been visited by physical therapists (PT) or occupational therapists (OT) after being discharged from the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). It captures the extent of post-ICU rehabilitation services provided to patients and can be important for understanding recovery trajectories.

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`PT or OT VISIT DAYS POST MICU`", 15)
```

This variable is important for our analysis as it will not effect our outcome variables.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Post ICU Days with Therapy

This variable is the percentage of days after a patient is discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during which they received therapy, such as physical therapy (PT) or occupational therapy (OT).

This variable is likely not important as it will not effect our outcome variables.

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`PERCENT POST ICU DAYS THERAPY`", 15)
```

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Age

```{r}
# Examine counts
pretty_print(table(data_ex$Age_Range))
```

That's curious, what does "Negative Age" mean?

```{r}
# Examine negative age
data_ex |> 
  filter(Age_Range == "Negative Age") |> 
  pretty_print()
```

I don't see any pattern.

Let's plot the counts.

```{r}
# Plot counts
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = Age_Range, fill = Age_Range)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Count by Age Range",
       x = "Age Range",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Age Range") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2")
```

We have a sufficient size for each group and can use age range as a covariate.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Age Quartile

This is just a different variable for age, where they divided the sample up by quartiles.

```{r}
# Check counts
table(data_ex$Age_Quartile)
```

We can use either age variables, it really shouldn't matter unless there is some important clinical distinction that is driving up their divisions in `Age_Range`.

[Top of Tabset](#Clean)

## Admit Date

`Admit_MonthYear` is a character. Let's go ahead and convert to datetime using `lubridate`.

```{r}
# Convert admit month year to datetime
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(Admit_MonthYear = ym(Admit_MonthYear))
```

Now we can plot how many patients were admitted each month.

We can also highlight the timeframe of the quality improvement iniative to visualize pre-, intra-, and post- periods.

```{r}
# Define the time periods to highlight
highlight_periods <- data.frame(
  start = as.Date(c("2015-04-01")),
  end = as.Date(c("2016-01-01"))
)

# Summarize and plot the data
data_ex |> 
  group_by(Admit_MonthYear) |> 
  summarise(count = n()) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Admit_MonthYear, y = count)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_rect(data = highlight_periods, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), 
            inherit.aes = FALSE, fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Admissions Over Time",
       x = "Admit Date",
       y = "Count")
```

It does not appear that the number of patients admitted throughout the year really changed that drastically. I don't think we will have to control for this.
::::

## Variable Creation {#Creation}

Here we will create any variables necessary for our analysis

::: panel-tabset
## Mechanical Ventilation

The researcher expressed that patients would be stratified on Mechanical ventilation v. NO mechanical ventilation. However, I do not see this variable. Let's go ahead and create it, assuming that patients with NA for `MV_TOTAL` were simply never on mechanical ventilation.

```{r}
# Dummy code MV status 
data_ex$MV_YN <- ifelse(is.na(data_ex$MV_Total), 0, 1)
```

Let's check that worked as intended.

```{r}
# Filter down to variables of interest to verify dummy coding worked

## Received Physical Therapy Variable Creation

Let's create a dummy variable for whether patients received PT or not.

```{r}
# Create variable for reception of PT
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(PT_YESNO = ifelse(is.na(`AVG THERAPY LENGTH`), 1,
                           ifelse(`AVG THERAPY LENGTH` == 0, 0, 1)))

# Double check calculations
data_ex |> 
  select(`AVG THERAPY LENGTH`, `DAYS WITH THERAPY VISITS`, PT_YESNO) |> 
  head() |> 
  pretty_print()

# Convert to factor for better plotting later on
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(PT_YESNO = as.factor(PT_YESNO))

```

Looks good, not we can answer one of their research questions of whether PT enrollment increased after the intervention.

## QI-Initiative Time Period

Let's group participants into the time period that they were present during the initiative for.

```{r}
# Create new variable based on QI initiative time period.
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(initiative = ifelse(Admit_MonthYear < as.Date("2015-04-01"), "Pre",
                             ifelse(Admit_MonthYear > as.Date("2015-12-01"), "Post", "During")))
```

Let's double check we did that right.

```{r}
# Check counts
table(data_ex$initiative)

# Double check assigning
data_ex |> 
  select(id, Admit_MonthYear, initiative) |> 
  filter(Admit_MonthYear < as.Date("2015-04-01")) |> 
  arrange(desc(Admit_MonthYear)) |> 
  head() |> 
  pretty_print()

# Double check assigning
data_ex |> 
  select(id, Admit_MonthYear, initiative) |> 
  filter(Admit_MonthYear > as.Date("2015-04-01")) |> 
  arrange(Admit_MonthYear) |> 
  head() |> 
  pretty_print()

# Double check assigning
data_ex |> 
  select(id, Admit_MonthYear, initiative) |> 
  filter(Admit_MonthYear >= as.Date("2015-12-01")) |> 
  arrange(Admit_MonthYear) |> 
  head() |> 
  pretty_print()

# Double check assigning
data_ex |> 
  select(id, Admit_MonthYear, initiative) |> 
  filter(Admit_MonthYear > as.Date("2015-12-01")) |> 
  arrange(Admit_MonthYear) |>

# Univariate Distributions

Here we will explore the univariate distributions of our variables to assess data quality using histograms and qqplots.

## Outcome Variables {#Outcome_Variables}

::: panel-tabset
## Mechanical Ventilation

First we will begin with mechanical ventilation time (MV)

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "MV_Total")
```

That's some severe right skewness! Is that logarithmic? Let's try and transform and see what happens.

```{r}
# Perform a log transform of mechanical ventilation time and plot
data_ex$MV_Total_log <- log(data_ex$MV_Total)

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "MV_Total_log", 10)
```

That's better. Maybe try a square root transformation?

```{r}
# Perform a sqrt transformation and plot
data_ex$MV_Total_sqrt <- sqrt(data_ex$MV_Total)

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "MV_Total_sqrt", 10)
```

That looks worse. Out of curiosity I'm going to try using the bestNormalize package I've been learning to see if it can recommend the best tranformation.

```{r}
BNobject <- bestNormalize(data_ex$MV_Total)
BNobject
```

The short explanation of how these values work is that the value closest to 1 is the best transformation, but these are all VERY far from one. So that didn't help.

#### Boxplot

```{r}
#Create boxplot to assess for outliers
ggplot(data_ex, aes(y = MV_Total_log)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of MV Total Log",
       y = "MV Total Log")
```

There are also no outliers for `MV_Total_Log!`

#### Summary

It looks like the best option we have is a log transformation of `MV TOTAL`.

Alternatively, we will likely end up running a Poisson or Negative Binomial regression to handle this data.

[Top of Tabset](#Outcome_Variables)

## MICU Length of Stay

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "Unit_LOS", 10)
```

That's super skewed as well! Let's try a log transform.

```{r}
# Perform log transform of MICU LOS
data_ex$Unit_LOS_log <- log(data_ex$Unit_LOS)

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "Unit_LOS_log", 10)
```

We've got more of an S shape going there. I wonder if a BoxCox transformation is more appropriate?

```{r}
library(bestNormalize)
# Use bestNormalize to try to find best transformation
BNobject <- bestNormalize(data_ex$Unit_LOS)
BNobject

# Perform boxcox transformation
data_ex$Unit_LOS_boxcox <- boxcox(data_ex$Unit_LOS)$x.t

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "Unit_LOS_boxcox", 25)
```

```{r}
# Create boxplot to assess for outliers
ggplot(data_ex, aes(y = Unit_LOS_boxcox)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

There are no outliers for boxcox Unit LOS.

That histogram looks better at least, and we don't have any outliers. The bestNormalize package offers ways to back transform after you run your analysis, but I haven't gotten that far in learning it yet. It looks like a boxcox transformation is a candidate however.

#### Summary

Will come back to this. I think there is a specific link function we use in this situation when we have an s-shaped qq plot like that.

[Top of Tabset](#Outcome_Variables)

## Hospital Length of Stay

```{r}
# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "`HOSPITAL LOS`", 25)
```

`Hospital LOS` also looks logarithmic.

Let's transform and assess.

```{r}
# Perform log transform 
data_ex$HOSPITAL_LOS_log <- log(data_ex$`HOSPITAL LOS`)

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "HOSPITAL_LOS_log", 25)

ggplot(data_ex, aes(y = HOSPITAL_LOS_log)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Looks good! There are a handful of outliers in there, but the data looks normal and those values will likely be included.

#### Summary

`HOSPITAL LOS` is normal after a log transform. We will either perform that or a Poisson or Negative Binomial [Top of Tabset](#Outcome_Variables)

## Non-ICU Length of Stay

We must compute `NON_ICU_LOS` by subtracting `Unit_LOS` from `HOSPITAL LOS`.

```{r}
# Compute variable for non icu LOS.
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(NON_ICU_LOS = `HOSPITAL LOS` - Unit_LOS)

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "NON_ICU_LOS", 25)
```

As expected, that looks exponential.

```{r}
# Perform log transform
data_ex$NON_ICU_LOS_log <- log(data_ex$NON_ICU_LOS)

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "NON_ICU_LOS_log", 25)
```

That's bimodal. Odd.

Let's try a square root transform

```{r}
# Perform log transform
data_ex$NON_ICU_LOS_sqrt <- sqrt(data_ex$NON_ICU_LOS)

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "NON_ICU_LOS_sqrt", 25)
```

Looks crummy.

Let's try bestNormalize

```{r}
BNobject <- bestNormalize(data_ex$NON_ICU_LOS)
BNobject

# Perform boxcox transformation
data_ex$NON_ICU_LOS_yeo <- yeojohnson(data_ex$NON_ICU_LOS)$x.t

# Create histogram and qqplot
distr_plots(data_ex, "NON_ICU_LOS_yeo", 25)
```

Looks better! Still bimodal but much more normal.

#### Summary

Looks like Yeo-Johnson transformation may be the way to go.

## Discharge Location

```{r}
# Examine discharge locations
pretty_print(table(data_ex$DISCH_DISP))
```

There are a few options we have for to analyze discharge location.

-   We can spit on expired vs not expired
-   We can split on hom vs other
-   We can just look at all the groups with the largest N, and collapse the rest into a single variable of 'other'. This would be
    -   Expired (1137), Home (3177), Hospice (424), long term care (451), rehab (249), skilled Nursing facility (596)

We will have to ask the researcher how she wants to group up these discharge locations! Keeping in mind that since we are looking at three different time periods, each group will essentially by a third of what is shown here.

  select(-`PROBLEM LIST DX CODES`, -`PROBLEM LIST DX NAMES`, -DISCH_DISP, -`DEPT BEFORE Unit`, -`DEPT AFTER Unit`, -`CONSULT TO TREAT`, -`ADMIT TO TREAT`, - ACTUAL_DAYS_POST_MICU_log, - ADMIT_TO_CONSULT_log, -TOTAL_THERAPY_VISITS_log, -PT_YESNO, -initiative)

# We factored our variables at the start. To make a correlation matrix we must reconvert those back to numeric
data_for_matrix <- data.frame(lapply(data_for_matrix, function(x) if (is.factor(x)) as.numeric(x) else x))

# Plot the matrix

#### Main Obserations

The variables that are most correlated with our outcome variables of `UNIT_LOS` and `MV_Total` are:

-   `HOSPITAL_LOS`
-   `ADMIT.TO.CONSULT`
-   `PT_VISITS`
-   `DAYS.WITH.THERAPY.VISITS`
-   `AVERAGE THERAPY LENGTH`
-   `MAX THERAPY LENGTH`

These will be important to examine and potentially control for in our modelS.

# Bivariate Comparisons {#Bi}

::: panel-tabset
## Hospital Length of Stay

```{r}
# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = `HOSPITAL LOS`, y = Unit_LOS)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "MICU Length of Stay by Hospital Length of Stay",
       x = "Hospital Length of Stay",
       y = "MICU Length of stay")
```

This is an interesting shape! This sharp pattern is because some patients were admitted directly into the MICU. So there is a 1 to 1 connection between their hospital length of stay and MICU length of stay.

Basically we probably can't use `UNIT_LOS` as a covariate in this model because it is so intrinsically intertwined with `MICU LOS`.

[Top of Tabset](#Bi)

## Admit to Consult Time

### MICU Length of Stay

```{r}
# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = `ADMIT TO CONSULT`, y = Unit_LOS)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "MICU Length of Stay by Admit to Consult Time",
       x = "Admit to Consult Time",
       y = "MICU Length of stay") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

We can see that a lot of patients that were in the hospital did not receive a consult (values= 0). We may have to filter these patients out or run a zero-inflated regression.

The longer it took between a patient's admit to consult the longer they stayed in the MICU.

#### Total Mechanical Ventilation

```{r}
# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = `ADMIT TO CONSULT`, y = MV_Total)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Total Mechanical Ventilation Time by Admit to Consult Time",
       x = "Admit to Consult Time",
       y = "Mechanical Ventilation Time") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Perform the regression
model <- lm(MV_Total ~ `ADMIT TO CONSULT`, data = data_ex)
summary(model)
```

Similarly, many patients that were not mechanically ventilated.

Otherwise there is a strong linear relationship here.

The longer it took between a patient's admit to consult the more time they spent mechanically ventilated.

## Physical Therapy Visits

#### MICU Length of Stay

```{r}
# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = PT_VISITS, y = Unit_LOS)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "MICU Length of Stay by Hospital Length of Stay",
       x = "Number of PT Visits",
       y = "MICU Length of stay") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Perform the regression
model <- lm(Unit_LOS ~ PT_VISITS, data = data_ex)
summary(model)
```

This makes sense, patients that needed more intense and frequent PT visits did so because they had more extreme conditions and therefore stayed longer in the MICU.

#### Total Mechanical Ventilation Time

```{r}
# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = PT_VISITS, y = MV_Total)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Mechanical Ventilation Time by Number of PT Visits",
       x = "Number of PT Visits",
       y = "Mechanical Ventilation Time") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Perform the regression
model <- lm(MV_Total ~ PT_VISITS, data = data_ex)
summary(model)
```

Patients that had more PT visits had more time on mechanical ventilation, but they probably had more PT visits BECAUSE they were mechanically ventilated.

[Top of Tabset](#Bi)

## Days with Therapy Visits

#### MICU Length of Stay

```{r}
# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = `DAYS WITH THERAPY VISITS`, y = Unit_LOS)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "MICU Length of Stay by Days with Therapy Visits",
       x = "Days with Therapy Visits",
       y = "MICU Length of stay") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Perform the regression
model <- lm(Unit_LOS ~ `DAYS WITH THERAPY VISITS`, data = data_ex)
summary(model)
```

This is basically the same variables as `PT_VISITS`.

#### Mechanical Ventilation Time

```{r}
# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = PT_VISITS, y = MV_Total)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +

       y = "Mechanical Ventilation Time") +

## Average Therapy Length

# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = `AVG THERAPY LENGTH`, y = Unit_LOS)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "MICU Length of Stay by Average Therapy Length",
       x = "Average Therapy Length",
       y = "MICU Length of stay") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Perform the regression
model <- lm(Unit_LOS ~ `AVG THERAPY LENGTH`, data = data_ex)
summary(model)
```

Weaker but significant relationship.

#### Total Mechanical Ventilation Time

```{r}
# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = `AVG THERAPY LENGTH`, y = MV_Total)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "MICU Length of Stay by Average Therapy Length",
       x = "Average Therapy Length",
       y = "Total Mechanical Ventilation Time") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Perform the regression
model <- lm(MV_Total ~ `AVG THERAPY LENGTH`, data = data_ex)
summary(model)
```

Significant but weak. We should control for `Average therapy length`.

  labs(title = "Time from Admit to Consult over Time",
       x = "Admit Date",
       y = "Time from Admit to Consult")

They also successfully decreased the time from admit to consult. Megan may be interested in this.

# Seasonality

The investigator is concerned about seasonality effects, let's investigate.

```{r}
# First we need to create variables for month and year
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(Year = year(Admit_MonthYear),
         Month = as.factor(month(Admit_MonthYear)))

# Summarize and plot the data
data_ex |> 
  group_by(Month) |> 
  summarise(avg_Unit_LOS = mean(Unit_LOS, na.rm = T)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = avg_Unit_LOS, group = 1)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Average MICU LOS per Year",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Avg MICU LOS")
```

It appears that we do have seasonailty in our main outcome variable, and will have to account for this in our final model.

# Analysis: Main Goals {#Main_Goals}

### Goal 1: Increase Frequency of PT Visits

The first goal of the QI-initiative was to increase the frequency of PT visits.

To assess this, we will perform a Poisson Regression with the following formula:

$Log( E(admissions with PT_i | QI-Initiative_i ) ) = β_0 + β_1 * QI-Initiative_i + β2 *Covariates_i + ...$

::: panel-tabset

## Visualization

```{r}
# Summarize and plot the data
data_ex |> 
  group_by(Admit_MonthYear) |> 
  summarise(avg_pct_therapy = mean(PT_VISITS_PERC, na.rm = T)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Admit_MonthYear, y = avg_pct_therapy)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_rect(data = highlight_periods, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), 
            inherit.aes = FALSE, fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Average Percentage of Days with Physical Therapy Over Time",
       x = "Admit Date",
       y = "Average Days with Physical Therapy (%)")
```

Interesting! They successfully and drastically increased the percentage of days that patients had physical therapy (roughly from 10-20% pre-iniative to 50-60% post iniative). This percentage did seem to drop off over time during the post- initiative period however, though it is still higher than it was pre-initiative (now roughly 30-40%).

[Top of Tabset](#Main_Goals)

## Analysis

First, we must determine whether it is more appropriate to run a Poisson Regression or a Negative Binomial Regression.

To do this we will compare the mean and the variance of this `PT_VISITS`. If the variance is greater than the mean, than we have overdispersion and a negative binomial model is more appropriate.

#### Check for Overdispersion

```{r}
# Compare mean and variance
paste0("Mean = ", mean(data_ex$PT_VISITS))
paste0("Variance = ", var(data_ex$PT_VISITS))
```

In our case, the variance is higher than the mean, indicating that we have overdispersion, and hence the negative binomial model is more appropriate going forward.

We can also verify this by using the examining the dispersion of our poisson model.

```{r}
# Factoring initiative for better output in models
data_ex$initiative <- factor(data_ex$initiative, levels = c("Pre","During","Post"), labels = c("Pre", "During", "Post"))

# Convert to unordered factor 
data_ex$initiative <- factor(data_ex$initiative, ordered = FALSE)

# Perform the Poisson regression
model_goal1 <- glm(PT_VISITS ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month, data = data_ex, family = poisson())

# Check for overdispersion
dispersion <- sum(residuals(model_goal1, type = "pearson")^2) / df.residual(model_goal1)
print(dispersion)
```

The dispersion parameter is significantly greater than 1, and thus we have overdispersion.

#### Performing the Negative Binomial Regression

Since we know we have overdispersion, we can now perform the negative binomial regression 

```{r}
#| include: false
# Load packages for negative binomial regression and ZIF
# Have to put these down here because they break the code if placed at the top of the document
library(pscl) # Used for zero inflated models
library(MASS) # Used for negative binomial models
```

```{r}
# Fit a Negative Binomial model
model_goal1_nb <- glm.nb(PT_VISITS ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month, data = data_ex)

# Examine Model
summary(model_goal1_nb)

```

#### Zero Inflated Negative Binomial Regression

A zero inflated regression is appropriate in the case of excess zeroes that are generated by a separate process from the count values. This means there are two processes: one that generates only zeros (e.g., not participating in an activity) and another that generates counts including zeros (e.g., participating but not succeeding).

In our case, there are likely a lot of patients that had no need for PT, and those that did but chose not to receive it, thus create two processes for a zero in our outcome variables.

Let's test.

```{r}
# Fit the zero-inflated negative binomial

# Examine Model

#### Change Reference Level
```{r}
# Change reference level
data_ex$initiative <- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = "During")

# Fit the zero-inflated negative binomial
model_goal1_zifb <- zeroinfl(PT_VISITS ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month| initiative, data = data_ex, dist = "negbin")

# Examine Model
summary(model_goal1_zifb)

# Get 95% CI's
CIs <- confint(model_goal1_zifb)
pretty_print(CIs)
```

#### Model Selection

We can now compare model performance using AIC and BIC to determine if the ZIF model improves performance.

For fun let's include the poisson regression model and see how it compares,

```{r}
# Compare model performance
bic_p <- BIC(model_goal1)
bic_nb <- BIC(model_goal1_nb)
bic_zifb <- BIC(model_goal1_zifb)

aic_p <- AIC(model_goal1)
aic_nb <- AIC(model_goal1_nb)
aic_zifb <- AIC(model_goal1_zifb)

# Create a data frame to display the values 
model_comparison <- data.frame(Model = c("Poisson Model", "Negative Binomial Model", "ZIF Negative Binomial Model"), 
                               BIC = c(bic_p, bic_nb, bic_zifb), 
                               AIC = c(bic_p, aic_nb, aic_zifb))

# Print resulting table
pretty_print(model_comparison)
```

We can also perform a likelihood ratio test to get a significance value we can report.

```{r}
# Perform the likelihood ratio test 
lr_test <- lrtest(model_goal1_nb, model_goal1_zifb) 
# Print the test result 
print(lr_test)
```


We can see that AIC and BIC both prefer the zero inflated model, and thus the **Zero Inflated Binomial Regression will be chosen as the final model for goal 1.**

## Interpretation

##### Overall Model

The likelihood ratio test indicates that the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model provides a significantly better fit than the standard Negative Binomial model (χ² = 30.78, df = 3, p < 0.0001), supporting the decision to run the analysis as a zero inflated model.

##### Main Effects

QI-initiative time period is a significant predictor for frequency of PT visits, while controlling for age, admission month, and zero inflation. Compared to patients in the Pre time period, patients in the During time period had a mean number of PT visits that was 3.29 times higher (z = 20.88, 95% CI: [2.94, 3.68], p < 0.0001), and patients in the Post time period had a mean number of PT visits that was 2.42 times higher (z = 19.63, 95% CI: [2.22, 2.64], p < 0.0001). Additionally, compared to patients in the During time period, those in the Post time period had a mean number of PT visits that was 0.74 times the mean number of PT visits (z = -6.78, 95% CI: [0.67, 0.80], p < 0.0001).

##### Age

Age was a significant predictor for frequency of PT visits, while controlling for QI-initiative time period, admission month, and zero inflation. Compared to those who were 18-39, patients who were 50-59 had a 1.12 times higher mean number of PT visits (z = 2.30, 95% CI: [1.02, 1.23], p = 0.021), patients who were 60-69 had a 1.24 times higher mean number of PT visits (z = 4.53, 95% CI: [1.13, 1.35], p = < 0.0001), and patients who were 70+ had a 1.20 times higher mean number of PT visits (z = 3.69, 95% CI: [1.09, 1.32], p =  0.0002). Patients who were 40-49 did not have a statistically significant difference in mean number of PT visits compared to those who were 18-39 (z = -1.166, 95% CI: [0.84, 1.04], p = 0.24).

#### Seasonality

Month was not a significant predictor in this model (p's for each month  > 0.5), but was included in the final model to account for potential seasonality effects.

##### Overdispersion 

The estimate of log(θ) in this model is highly significant (𝛽^log(θ) = 0.3723, z = 9.581, p < 0.0001), indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis that log(theta) equals zero. When exponentiated, θ = exp(0.3723) ≈ 1.45, suggesting that the variance of the count data is approximately 1.45 times greater than the mean, which highlights significant overdispersion. This confirms that the use of a negative binomial distribution is appropriate for modeling our data, as it effectively handles the extra variability compared to a simpler Poisson model.

##### Zero Inflation

When controlling for age range and month, the initiative time period did not significantly affect the probability of zero PT visits (all p's > 0.05). This suggests that the likelihood of being a structural zero is independent of QI-initiative time period.

[Top of Tabset](#Main_Goals)

## Summary

We found that, while controlling for age, admission month, and zero inflation, those in the During time period had a 3.29 times higher (p < 0.0001), and those in the Post time period had a 2.42 times higher (p < 0.0001) average number of PT visits compared to patients in the Pre time period.

Additionally, there was a slight decrease in the number of PT visits from the During to Post time periods, with those in the Post period having a mean number of PT visits that was 0.74 times the mean number of PT visits of those in the During period (p < 0.0001).

Additionally, there was an overall effect for age, where patients that were 50 and older received more PT visits than those who were 18-39.

       y = "Time from Admit to Therapy")
```

They successfully decreased the time from a patient's first admit to their first physical therapy session.

This means that patients were receiving PT sooner.

[Top of Tabset](#Goal_Two)

## Analysis

#### Correct Erroneous Value

Note: We have a patient with a -1 value for admit to treat time, which is not allowed in a poisson or negative binomial model, and is also not possible, so we will set this to NA.

```{r}
# Remove patient with -1 value for Admit to Treat time
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(`ADMIT TO TREAT` = ifelse(`ADMIT TO TREAT` == -1, NA, `ADMIT TO TREAT`))
```

#### Check for Overdispersion

```{r}
# Compare mean and variance
paste0("Mean = ", mean(data_ex$`ADMIT TO TREAT`, na.rm = T))
# Compare mean and variance
paste0("Variance = ", var(data_ex$`ADMIT TO TREAT`, na.rm = T))
```

The variance is drastically greater than the mean, indicating that a negative binomial regression is more appropriate.

#### Performing the Negative Binomial Regression

```{r}
# Change reference level
data_ex$initiative <- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = "Pre")

# Fit a Negative Binomial model
model_goal2_nb <- glm.nb(`ADMIT TO TREAT` ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month, data = data_ex)

# Examine Model
summary(model_goal2_nb)

plot(model_goal2_nb)

# Get 95% CI's
CIs <- confint(model_goal2_nb)
pretty_print(CIs)
```


#### Change Reference Category

```{r}
# Change reference level
data_ex$initiative <- relevel(data_ex$initiative, ref = "During")

# Fit a Negative Binomial model
model_goal2_nb <- glm.nb(`ADMIT TO TREAT` ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month, data = data_ex)

# Examine Model
summary(model_goal2_nb)

# Get 95% CI's
CIs <- confint(model_goal2_nb)
pretty_print(CIs)
```


Since patients that did not receive a consult were coded as `NA` instead of 0, we do not have to perform a zero inflated regression this time.

##### Model Comparison

```{r}
# Perform the Poisson regression
model_goal2 <- glm(`ADMIT TO TREAT` ~ initiative + Age_Range + Month, data = data_ex, family = poisson())

# Compare model performance
bic_p <- BIC(model_goal2)
bic_nb <- BIC(model_goal2_nb)

aic_p <- AIC(model_goal2)
aic_nb <- AIC(model_goal2_nb)

# Create a data frame to display the values 
model_comparison <- data.frame(Model = c("Poisson Model", "Negative Binomial Model"), 
                               BIC = c(bic_p, bic_nb), 
                               AIC = c(bic_p, aic_nb))

# Print resulting table
pretty_print(model_comparison)
```

AIC and BIC drastically prefer the negative binomial model, indicating it is a better fit for our data.

```{r}
# Perform the likelihood ratio test 
lr_test <- lrtest(model_goal2, model_goal2_nb) 
lr_test
```

The likelihood ratio test also confirms the negative binomial model performs better.

[Top of Tabset](#Goal_Two)

## Interpretation

#### Overall Model
The likelihood ratio test indicates that the Negative Binomial model provides a significantly better fit than the Poisson model (χ² = 134758, df = 1, p < 0.0001), supporting the decision to run the analysis as a Negative Binomial model due to overdispersion.

#### Main Effects
QI-initiative time period is a significant predictor for time from admit to treatment, while controlling for age and admission month. Compared to patients in the Pre time period, patients in the During time period had a mean admit to treatment time that was 0.40 times that of patients in the Pre period (z = 23.80, 95% CI: [0.37, 0.43], p < 0.0001), and patients in the Post time period had a mean admit to treatment time that was 0.51 times that of patients in the Pre period (z = -26.01, 95% CI: [0.48, 0.53], p < 0.0001). Additionally, compared to patients in the During time period, those in the Post time period had a mean admit to treatment time that was 1.26 times higher than that of patients during the During period (z = 6.37, 95% CI: [1.17, 1.35], p < 0.0001), indicating a slight increase in admit to treatment time after the During period.

#### Age
Age was a significant predictor for time from admit to treatment, while controlling for QI-initiative time period and admission month. Compared to those who were 18-39, patients who were 50-59 had 0.91 times (z = -2.497, 95% CI: [0.84, 0.98], p = 0.0125), patients who were 60-69 had 0.81 times (z = -5.60, 95% CI: [0.75, 0.87], p < 0.0001), and patients who were 70+ had 0.74 times (z = -7.70, 95% CI: [0.69, 0.80], p < 0.0001) the admit to treatment time. Patients who were 40-49 did not have a statistically significant difference in admit to treatment time compared to those who were 18-39 (z = -0.97, 95% CI: [-.88, 1.04], p = 0.33).

#### Seasonality
Admission Month was a significant predictor for admit to treatment time, while controlling for QI-initiative time period and age. For instance, those admitted during March had an admit to treatment time that was 0.80 times that of those admitted during January (z = -4.11, 95% CI: [0.71, 0.89, p < 0.0001]).

Since possible comparisons between months are myriad (12!), and the goal of this project was not to compare outcome variables between months (merely to control for these differences due to seasonality), further comparisons will not be made. 

[Top of Tabset](#Goal_Two)

## Summary

#### QI-Initiative

The QI-initiative successfully decreased the wait time from admit to therapy, with patients admitted in the During period having a mean wait time that was 0.40 times that of patients in the Pre period (p < 0.0001), and patients admitted in the Post period having a wait time that was 0.51 times that of patients in the Pre period (p < 0.0001). 

Additionally, there was a slight increase in wait time from admit to therapy after the QI-initiative, with those admitted in the Post time period having a mean wait time that was 1.26 times higher than that of patients during the During period (p < 0.0001).

The QI-initiative effectively halved the wait time from admission to therapy!

#### Age
There was an overall effect where patients that were 50 and older had an average admit to therapy wait time that was faster than patients who were 18-39. This indicates that patients who were 50 and older were being prioritized to receive physical therapy sooner.

#### Seasonality
There were significant differences in wait time from admit to therapy based on the month the patient was admitted, likely just due to differences in staffing (such as in December and January), making this important that we included `Admission Month` as a covariate in our model that we controlled for.

  labs(title = "Percentage of Admissions Receiving Physical Therapy",
       x = "Admit Date",
       y = "Percentage")

They successfully increased the percentage of patients receiving PT from \~40% pre-initiative to \~80% during the initiative. This percentage then decreases to \~70% post-initiative

For this model, we will perform a logistic regression to see if the likelihood of receiving physical therapy differs by QI-initiative time period.

```


[Top of Tabset](#Goal_3)

## Interpretation 

#### Main Effects
QI-initiative time period is a significant predictor for the likelihood of receiving PT, while controlling for age and admission month. Compared to patients in the Pre time period, the odds of receiving physical therapy in the During period were approximately 9.52 times higher (z = 18.144, 95% CI: [7.51, 12.22], p < 0.0001), and the odds of receiving physical therapy in the Post time period were 4.84 times higher (z = 26.41, 95% CI: [4.31, 5.44], p < 0.0001). The odds of receiving physical therapy in the Post time period were 0.51 the odds of receiving physical therapy in the during period (z = -5.35, 95% CI: [0.39,0.65], p < 0.0001).

#### Age
Age was a significant predictor for the likelihood of receiving PT, while controlling for QI-initiative time period and admission month. Compared to those who were 18-39, the odds of receiving physical therapy were 1.42 times higher for patients aged 50-59  (z = 4.04, 95% CI: [1.20, 1.69], p < 0.0001), 1.91 times higher for patients aged 60-69 (z = 7.30, 95% CI: [1.60, 2.27], p < 0.0001 ), and 2.15 times higher for patients age 70+  (z = 8.273, 95% CI: [1.79,], p = 2.58). The odds of receiving PT did not differ significantly between patients who were 18-39 and those who were 40-49 (z = 1.96, 95% CI: [1.00, 1.48], p = 0.0502).

#### Seasonality
Admission Month was not a significant predictor for the likelihood of receiving PT (p’s for each month > 0.5), but was included in the final model to account for potential seasonality effects.

[Top of Tabset](#Goal_3)

## Summary

#### QI-Initiative
The QI-initiative was successful at increasing the likelihood that patients received physical therapy. Compared to patients in the Pre time period, the odds of receiving physical therapy in the During period were approximately 9.52 times higher (p < 0.0001), and the odds of receiving physical therapy in the Post time period were 4.84 times higher (p < 0.0001). 

Additionally, there was a decrease in the likelihood of receiving PT after the During period, with the odds of receiving physical therapy in the Post time period being 0.51 the odds of receiving physical therapy in the during period (p < 0.0001).

#### Age
There was an overall effect, where patients 50 years and older were more likely to receive PT compared to those 18-39 years old, while controlling for QI-initiative time period and admission month.

This is again evidence that older patients were receiving priority for PT.

  labs(title = "Average MICU LOS over Time",
       x = "Admit Date",
       y = "Avg MICU LOS")
```

It does not appear that `MICU_LOS` has decreased across any of the time periods.

This is including patients that did not receive PT, so of course there's no difference.

#### MICU LOS over Time by Mechanical Ventilation

```{r}
# Dummy code MV status 
data_ex$MV_YN <- ifelse(is.na(data_ex$MV_Total), 0, 1)

# Make it a factor for better plotting
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(MV_YN = as.factor(MV_YN))

# Summarize and plot the data
data_ex |> 
  group_by(Admit_MonthYear, MV_YN) |> 
  summarise(avg_Unit_LOS = mean(Unit_LOS, na.rm = T)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Admit_MonthYear, y = avg_Unit_LOS, color = MV_YN, group = MV_YN)) +
  geom_line() +

  geom_rect(data = highlight_periods, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), 
            inherit.aes = FALSE, fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Average MICU LOS over Time by Mechanical Ventilation",
       x = "Admit Date",
       y = "Avg MICU LOS")
```

This shows that those who were mechanically ventilated had a higher MICU length of stay. This does not appear to have differed in relation to the QI iniative.

I am also including those that did not receive PT here, so that would explain the null finding.

```{r}
#| warning: false
# Summarize and plot the data
data_ex |> 
  group_by(Admit_MonthYear, MV_YN, PT_YESNO) |> 
  summarise(avg_Unit_LOS = mean(Unit_LOS, na.rm = T)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Admit_MonthYear, y = avg_Unit_LOS, color = PT_YESNO)) +
  geom_point() +

  labs(title = "Average MICU LOS over Time by Mechanical Ventilation",
       x = "Admit Date",
       y = "Avg MICU LOS") +
  facet_wrap(~MV_YN)
```

I *think* this might show an interaction. For those on mechanical ventilation, they seemed to decrease in MICU LOS more if they received PT.

For those not on MV, the PT did not seem to change their average LOS.

```

Interesting! It does look like average MICU length of stay decreased slighly immediately after the QI initiative. It also looks like it may be increasing slightly from then on.

That does appear that those received PT had a decrease before and after the iniative

But overall it looks like the QI may have successfuly decreased MICU LOS.

#### Fitting with Splines

```{r}
library(splines)
# Summarize and plot the data
data_ex |> 
  group_by(Admit_MonthYear, PT_YESNO) |> 
  summarise(avg_Unit_LOS = mean(Unit_LOS, na.rm = T)) |> 
  filter(Admit_MonthYear > as.Date("2012-01-01")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Admit_MonthYear, y = avg_Unit_LOS, color = PT_YESNO, group = PT_YESNO)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ ns(x, df = 4), se = F) +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_rect(data = highlight_periods, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), 
            inherit.aes = FALSE, fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Average MICU LOS over Time by Physical Therapy",
       x = "Admit Date",
       y = "Avg MICU LOS")
```

#### Some Graphing

```{r}
data_ex <- data_ex |> 
  mutate(initiative = as.factor(initiative)) |> 
  mutate(initiative = relevel(initiative, ref = "Pre"))

ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = PT_YESNO, y = Unit_LOS_log, fill = initiative)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2")
```

This shows that MICU LOS decreased in the during and post QI initiative periods compared to the pre-iniatitive period.

```{r}
data_ex |> 
  filter(PT_YESNO == 1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = initiative, y = Unit_LOS_log, fill = initiative)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2")
```

```{r}
data_ex |> 
  filter(PT_YESNO == 1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = initiative, y = Unit_LOS_log, fill = initiative)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2")
```

There is an interaction here between PT and unit LOS and initiative.

In other words, you HAVE to filter based on PT

#### MV Total

```{r}
ggplot(data_ex, aes(x = PT_YESNO, y = MV_Total_log, fill = initiative)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2")
```

# Bonus

## Check for Repeat Admissions

```{r}
# Check for repeate admissions
length(unique(data_ex$id))
dim(data_ex)
```

The number of unique patient id's is the same number as the number of rows in our data set.

So we do not have repeate admissions in this data set and do not need to account for repeated measures! (We meet the assumption of independent observations)

# To Do

Come back to the likelihood of being a structural zero for ZINF models.
